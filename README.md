# MandatoryAPP

I have made the project without a database witch is also my biggest regred in the app and how the solution to the issues have come out...
i am in general slightly disapointed with it all and i have struggles with making the mailing part work right. if i work further on this project i will
without a doubt rework it in a way with a database when coming to the deploying part i will be using firebase becuase i was looking a little bit into
it and it seems like it would make sense to have deploy place and database the same place. if i had time these would be the first changes i would implement
